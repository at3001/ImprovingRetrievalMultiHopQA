A contemporary review judged it \"gotten up in good taste and well; and is in nothing overdone.

            "  Passage 1: Chang Ucchin (26 November 1917 – 27 December 1990) is one of the representatives of modern Korean fine art.  Chang was born when Korea was still under Japanese colonial rule.  He studied western art at Tokyo's Imperial School of Art.  He became a professor of fine arts at Seoul National University in 1954, but resigned to paint full-time from 1960.. Korea under Japanese rule began with the end of the short-lived Korean Empire in 1910 and ended at the conclusion of World War II in 1945.  Japanese rule of Korea was the outcome of a process that began with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876, whereby a complex coalition of the Meiji government, military, and business officials sought to integrate Korea both politically and economically into the Empire of Japan.  A major stepping-stone towards the Japanese occupation of Korea was the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905, in which the then-Korean Empire was declared a protectorate of Japan.  The annexation of Korea by Japan was set up in the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910, which was never actually signed by the Korean Regent, Gojong.. At the conclusion of World War II the Allied nations began the process of disarmament of Axis controlled regions.  Japan occupied Korea at this time and had been in control since 1910.  In 1945, the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north.  At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action.  The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era.  Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea.  Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system.  Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support.  South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union.  The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea's request for weapons and troops.  North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested.  This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea.  North Korea saw its opportunity and attacked South Korean forces at the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950 and thus initiating the Korean War.\n",
            "  Passage 2: Chang Yong-hak (25 April 1921 – 31 August 1999) was a Korean writer.  Chang was born in Hamyeong Buk-do in what is now North Korea.  He studied at Waseda University in Japan, before being drafted into the Japanese army.  After the end of World War Two, he taught high school in Korea, writing fiction on the side.. World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier.  It involved the vast majority of the world's countries—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis.  It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries.  In a state of total war, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources.. The Eastern Front of World War II was a theatre of conflict between the European Axis powers and co-belligerent Finland against the Soviet Union, Poland and other Allies, which encompassed Northern, Southern and Central and Eastern Europe from 22 June 1941 to 9 May 1945.  It has been known as the Great Patriotic War (Russian: Великая Отечественная Война , \"Velikaya Otechestvennaya Voyna\") in the former Soviet Union, while in Germany it was called the Eastern Front (German: \"die Ostfront\" ), the Eastern Campaign (\"der Ostfeldzug\"), the Russian Campaign (\"der Rußlandfeldzug\"), or the German-Soviet War by outside parties.\n",

The Battle of Byeokjegwan (or Pyŏkje) (Chinese: 碧蹄館大戰; \"Bì tí guǎn dàzhàn\") was a battle fought on January 27, 1593 (January 26 according to the Japanese calendar of the time), between the armies of the Ming Dynasty led by Li Rusong, and the Japanese forces under Tachibana Muneshige, Ukita Hideie, and Kobayakawa Takakage.  As part of the Japanese Invasion of Korea (Imjin War), it was the first field battle fought during the war between the two sides.\n",

Sir Francis Tanfield (born 1565, date of death unknown) was Proprietary Governor of the South Falkland colony (in modern Newfoundland) of Henry Cary, 1st Viscount Falkland, his cousin's husband.  Tanfield was to establish a colony at Renews and left England in 1623 with an unknown number of colonists.  The settlers were harassed by migratory fishermen who used the harbour.  He was the leader of the colony of \"South Falkland\" from 1623 to 1625.

It was designed by the Architect Sir Frederick Gibberd and has two Auditoria, the first of which is a traditional Theatre which can hold 667 people.  The second is a Cinema/Studio Theatre which holds up to 188, which shows films or used as a small theatre space.. The Royal Pump Rooms (signed Royal Pump Room and Baths) is a Grade II listed building on the Parade in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, England.  It was the most famous of several spa baths opened in Leamington between the late-18th and mid-19th centuries.  People would travel from throughout the country, and indeed Europe, to benefit from treatments using the town's healing waters.  When 'taking the waters' became less fashionable after the mid-19th century the Pump Rooms became Leamington's only surviving spa facility, later also being extended to include the town's public swimming pool.  After a major redevelopment in 1997-99 the building now houses \"Leamington Spa Art Gallery & Museum\", a public library, a Tourist Information Centre, cafe and assembly rooms.\n",

A Republican lawyer from Vermont, Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics, eventually becoming governor of that state.  His response to the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action.  Soon after, he was elected as the 29th vice president in 1920 and succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. Harding in 1923.  Elected in his own right in 1924, he gained a reputation as a small-government conservative, and also as a man who said very little, although having a rather dry sense of humor..

Both pieces of legislation propose the creation of a National Intelligence Director.  Neither bill passed into law.. Diane Roark is an American whistleblower who served as a Republican staffer on the House Intelligence Committee from 1985 to 2002.  She was, right after 9/11, \"the House Intelligence Committee staffer in charge of oversight of the NSA\".  Along with William Binney, Ed Loomis, and J. Kirk Wiebe, she filed a complaint to the Department of Defense's Inspector General (DoD IG) about the National Security Agency's highly classified Trailblazer Project.  Her house was raided by armed FBI agents in 2007 after she was wrongly suspected of leaking to \"The New York Times\" reporter James Risen and to Siobhan Gorman at the \"The Baltimore Sun\" in stories about NSA warrantless surveillance.  This led to her suing the government in 2012 because they did not return her computer, which they had seized during the raid, and because the government failed to clear her name.  The punitive treatment of Roark, Binney, Wiebe, and Loomis, as well as, and, in particular, then still active (rather than retired) NSA executive Thomas Andrews Drake, who had gone in confidence with anonymity assured to the DoD IG, led the Assistant Inspector General John Crane to eventually become a public whistleblower himself and also led Edward Snowden to go public with revelations rather than to report within the internal whistleblower program.\n",
